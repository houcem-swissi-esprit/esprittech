        <p>Created in 2010, ESPRIT-Tech is the Research-Development-Innovation (RDI) structure at ESPRIT.</p>
        <p>Since the establishment of the training programs, the RDI activity at ESPRIT has become one of the priorities in the strategic choices.</p>
        <p>Through this entity, ESPRIT faculty are interconnected and can benefit from funding and support opportunities, including grants, RDI training, partnership development, contract negotiation, as well as commercialization assistance. ESPRIT-Tech develops strategies, and future directions for RDI activities, in close collaboration with relevant stakeholders. Furthermore, it gives special priority to applied research and innovation, without excluding basic research.</p>

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <div class="red-line"></div>
        <p>ESPRIT-Tech is a research structure led by a director who oversees all strategic and operational aspects.</p>
        <p>In order to carry out its activity, ESPRIT-Tech has set up a structure that responds to its mission: teams are created in order to carry out RDI projects around themes and research axes. Students can be associated to these works through their end of studies projects.</p>
        <p>ESPRIT-Tech created in December 2015 a research committee: C-RDI (RDI Committee), composed of all the team leaders. It is responsible for boosting research activities and ensuring the quality of productions. It meets on average once a month.</p>
        <p>For a better functioning, the RDI Committee has a secretariat (SC-RDI) composed of 5 members who meet regularly. Its role is to solve problems by applying the decisions taken by the C-RDI.</p>
